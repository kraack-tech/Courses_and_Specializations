Week 4 Overview
Elasticities
Overview

Welcome to the fourth week! This module we will cover one of my favorite economics concepts: elasticity. It is one of my favorites because of how useful it is to analyze policy implications, as well as its usefulness for business managers. This will be obvious to you when you read one of the discussion topics for this module: Should we legalize marijuana?

Specifically, we'll introduce the following 4 elasticities:

    Price elasticity of demand

    Income elasticity of demand

    Cross-price elasticity of demand

    Price elasticity of supply

Then we will discuss an important application of the concept of elasticity: the effects of excise taxes.

    Classify different goods according to their price elasticity of demand.

    Use the concept of the price elasticity of demand to determine the distributional effects of an excise tax. 

    Use the concept of the price elasticity of demand to determine the welfare effects of an excise tax.
