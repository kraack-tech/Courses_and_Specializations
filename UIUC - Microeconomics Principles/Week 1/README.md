Textbook and Readings

The lectures for the course are all self-contained and free. Yet a great resource to help you complete the course is my Course Packet. This Course Packet provides two valuable things for you. First, it provides you with an abbreviated version of the content I provide in the free lectures, but mostly in text format. Hence, it is a great way to find the information you need when you are completing the quizzes, for instance.  Second, it provides many new Economic Applications beyond the ones I include for free in this Coursera course.  For instance, it has a chapter on Women in the Workforce, and another on the Economics of Cheating.   

The regular price for this Course Packet is $25, yet I offer it to any Coursera student for only $4.99! And when you purchase it you get a lifetime subscription to it, which is a great value considering I update the Packet regularly by adding new applications. For instance, currently, the Course Packet has a section on Game Theory, which is not part of this course.
