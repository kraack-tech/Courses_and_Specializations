Week 7 Overview
Firms with Market Power
Overview

So, why is it that when you fly the person sitting next to you in the plane probably paid a different price for the ticket than what you paid for it? And why does Starbucks charge so much for its coffee even though you can buy coffee at Dunkin Donuts for almost half of that price?

This module we are finishing our discussion of the firm by focusing on cases that should be more familiar to you than the perfect competition examples we have been using. We are going to talk about firms that do have some control over the price, or have some "monopoly" power. As you will learn, this is the case for firms such as Apple, Starbucks, Microsoft, E-bay, and many other famous brands. We will learn the way these firms choose how much quantity to produce, and, more importantly, how they decide to price their goods and services. Along these lines, we will talk about price discrimination and many other fascinating strategies firms use to price their goods.
