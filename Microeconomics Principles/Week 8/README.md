Week 8 Overview
Public Goods, Common Resources, and Externalities
Overview

And so we have arrived at the last week. This course has gone too fast! This module we will be discussing market failures. A market failure is a situation when the market does not do a good job of distributing resources among members of society. In fact, in all of these cases the market IS the problem. We already talked about 1 type of market failure: monopoly. This module we introduced the other types: public goods, common resources, and externalities.
