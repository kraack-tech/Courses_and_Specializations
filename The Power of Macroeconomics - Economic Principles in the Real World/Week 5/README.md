# The Power of Macroeconomics: Economic Principles in the Real World
#### By University of California, Irvine


Module Overview: The Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy
Monetary or fiscal policy? Monetarism or Keynesianism? These became the macroeconomic questions in the 1970s as the nation found itself first fighting a soaring inflation and then a virulent stagflation. In this module, we're going to explore these questions and explain how Monetarism emerged in the 1970s to challenge the Keynesian orthodoxy.
To do so, we first have to describe our money and banking system and explain how the nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve, creates money. Once we get these basics down, we can then talk about how contractionary or expansionary monetary policy may be used to fight inflation or close a recessionary gap.
The major policy point we shall make is this-and it may seem paradoxical-it is actually the Keynesian economists, not the Monetarists, who support an activist role for monetary policy in fighting recessions and inflation.
