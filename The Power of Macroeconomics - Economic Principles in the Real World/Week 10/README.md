# The Power of Macroeconomics: Economic Principles in the Real World
#### By University of California, Irvine


Module Overview: International Trade and Protectionism
NAFTA, GATT and the Euro. Tariffs, quotas, and trade deficits. Dumping, nonÂ¬ tariff barriers, and protectionism. This is the language of international economics, and people all across the globe are speaking it in newspapers, corporate offices, retail stores, and union halls.
In the next two modules, we are going to look very closely at some important issues in international trade. To begin this module, we will look from a theoretical perspective at why nations trade. In doing so, we will learn about Adam Smith's theory of absolute advantage and its much more compelling cousin, David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage. We will also demonstrate the gains from trade.
Once we get these concepts down, we will turn to the thorny issue of trade barriers and protectionism, taking special care to explain the important economic and political differences between protectionist tools such as tariffs, quotas, and non-tariff barriers. After a discussion of the pros and cons of protectionism, we will then end the module with an examination of important multi-lateral trade agreements such as those embodied in NAFTA and the GATT.
