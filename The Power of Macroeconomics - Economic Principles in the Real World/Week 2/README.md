Module Overview
Module Overview: An Overview of Modern Macroeconomics
This module illustrates just how important macroeconomics can be in your personal and professional life. This module also provides a very informative historical overview of the development of modern macroeconomics. Beginning with Classical economics, we see how, over time, new theories like Keynesianism, Monetarism, Supply-side economics, and New Classical economics have emerged to try and cope with problems that the previous theories could not solve.
You should find such a history very useful in helping you to remember some of the more difficult theoretical material that you will encounter this course. Ultimately, it is only after we come to understand how macroeconomics has evolved--and how it keeps evolving over time--that we will come to realize just how important and relevant this subject is to everything we do.
